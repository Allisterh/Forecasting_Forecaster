# FORECASTER: A shiny webapp for time series analysis and experimentation of time series forecasting models 

The app is available through the following url: https://pablochaure.shinyapps.io/Forecaster/ and is deployed using shinyapps.io service by RStudio.

The Deep Learning features of Forecaster are not available currently through the deployed version. However, if you wish to train DL models to forecast your time series, you may do so through cloning the repo and deploying the app locally.

I would love to get feedback from users and developers and, if you feel like contributing, please fork the repo and submit your PRs!
