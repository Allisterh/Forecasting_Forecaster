# FORECASTER: A shiny webapp for time series analysis and experimentation of time series forecasting models 

The app is available through the following url: https://pablochaure.shinyapps.io/Forecaster/ and is deployed using shinyapps.io service by RStudio.

The content of this repository corresponds to the dissertation of my studies in a [Bachelor's Degree in Business Analytics, Economics and Finance at Universidad Pontifica Comillas - ICADE](https://www.comillas.edu/en/degrees/dual-degree-program-in-business-analytics-and-law-e-3-analytics) in Madrid, Spain. The dissertation document is only in Spanish and it may be accessed [here](https://repositorio.comillas.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11531/57409/TFG%20-%20Chaure%20Cordero%2c%20Pablo.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y).

**Known issues:**

- The Deep Learning features of Forecaster are not available currently through the deployed version. However, if you wish to train DL models to forecast your time series, you may do so through cloning the repo and deploying the app locally.
- Date frequencies with lower granularity than day (hourly, minutely, secondly) do not always work.

I would love to get feedback from users and developers and, if you feel like contributing, please fork the repo and submit your PRs!
